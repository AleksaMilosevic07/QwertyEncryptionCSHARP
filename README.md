# QWERTY Decryption

This entire project has been remade in C#, old version in C++ can be found here: https://github.com/AleksaMilosevic07/QWERTY-decryption
The basic idea behind this project is that it can serve as a password generator.

How does QWERTY decryption work? It is quite simple; it is inspired by the QWERTY-style keyboard that you are probably using right now. Essentially, you use the key above your desired key. For example, if you want to type the letter Q, you will type what is above the letter Q, which is 1. 

Suddenly, Q becomes 1, W becomes 2, and so on.

Examples:

- QWERTY ==> 123456
- PYTHON ==> 065Y9H

Let’s break down the "PYTHON" example. Look at your keyboard.

- You want the letter P, so you type the letter above it, which is 0.
- You want the letter Y, so you type the letter above it, which is 6.
- You want the letter T, so you type the letter above it, which is 5.
- You want the letter H, so you type the letter above it, which is Y.
- You want the letter O, so you type the letter above it, which is 9.
- You want the letter N, so you type the letter above it, which is H.

How can you use this? 

My main idea is that you can use this to create secure passwords without having to write them down or remember them. By using this method of encryption, you can turn regular, easy-to-remember words into something that is not easily decrypted and is hard to guess. 

For example, let’s say you want to create a password and your name is John Smith.

JohnSmith ==> U9YHWJ85Y

John Smith suddenly becomes something that no one can guess, and the best part is, the QWERTY encryption is easy to learn at first glance. 

I would highly value your feedback. Also, you are free to use this code however you like, just please give credit where it is due—it means a lot!
